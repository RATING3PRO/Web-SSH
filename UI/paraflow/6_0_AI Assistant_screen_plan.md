### Chat History Display
Shows the chronological conversation history between the user and the AI assistant. Each exchange includes the user's query and the AI's response. AI responses are structured to clearly present command suggestions, detailed explanations, and formatted code snippets, with support for syntax highlighting and an easy-to-use one-click copy functionality for code blocks.

### Input Field and Send Button
Located at the bottom of the panel, this module consists of a text input area where users can type their questions, commands, or requests for the AI. Adjacent to the input field is a prominent send button (e.g., a paper airplane icon) to submit the query to the AI assistant.
