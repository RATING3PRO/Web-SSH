## 2. Core Problems

1.  **Inconvenient Remote Server Access**: Traditional SSH clients require specific software installations, limiting access from various devices or shared workstations, and often lack a unified, browser-based solution.
2.  **Suboptimal Productivity & Learning Curve**: Users, especially new ones, struggle with remembering complex Linux commands or finding quick solutions, leading to slower operations and a steeper learning curve for server management tasks.

## 3. Users & Scenarios

### Key Personas

-   **System Administrator** — Manages and maintains multiple servers for an organization, often needing to quickly access different machines from various locations or devices. Goal: Securely and efficiently perform server maintenance, troubleshooting, and configuration updates. Pain points: Tedious setup for each client, lack of mobile access, managing multiple credentials.
-   **Developer** — Focuses on deploying, debugging, and testing applications on remote development or staging servers. Goal: Rapidly iterate on code, debug issues, and execute commands directly on the server without context switching. Pain points: Switching between IDE and separate SSH client, remembering specific commands, lack of integrated assistance.
-   **Operations Personnel** — Monitors server health, performs routine checks, and executes predefined scripts on production systems. Goal: Reliably access live systems for monitoring, logging, and incident response with minimal setup overhead. Pain points: Needing a consistent interface across team members, ensuring security without installing full clients on every machine.

### Core Task Flow (Happy Path)

1.  User navigates to the Web SSH Terminal Pro application in their browser.
2.  User inputs the server address, port, username, and selects the authentication method (e.g., password).
3.  User clicks the "Connect" button.
4.  Upon successful connection, the terminal display on the right activates, showing the server's command prompt.
5.  User types commands into the terminal and receives output.

## 5. Competition & Inspiration

-   **Termius** — *Highlights:* Modern UI, cross-platform sync, session management. *Watch-outs:* Primarily a desktop application, not fully web-based for ubiquitous access.
-   **Hyper** — *Highlights:* Highly customizable, built with web technologies (Electron), vibrant plugin ecosystem. *Watch-outs:* Can be resource-intensive, setup might be complex for non-developers.
-   **VS Code Terminal** — *Highlights:* Seamlessly integrated into a powerful IDE, rich feature set for developers, AI extensions available. *Watch-outs:* Requires VS Code installation, not a standalone web SSH solution.
-   **Material Design 3 / Fluent Design** — *Highlights:* Provides robust guidelines for modern, responsive, and accessible UI components, emphasizing dark themes, rounded corners, and elevated surfaces.
-   **DaisyUI** — *Highlights:* Tailwind CSS component library offering clean, customizable, and modern design elements with a focus on ease of use and responsive design, inspiring the smooth, rounded aesthetic.
